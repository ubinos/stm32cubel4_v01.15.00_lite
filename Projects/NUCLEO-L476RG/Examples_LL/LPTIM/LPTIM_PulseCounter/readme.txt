@par Example Description

How to use the LPTIM peripheral in counter mode to generate a PWM output signal 
and update its duty cycle. This example is based on the STM32L4xx
LPTIM LL API. The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

To reduce power consumption, MCU enters stop mode after starting counting. Each
time the counter reaches the maximum value (Period/Autoreload), an interruption
is generated, the MCU is woke up from stop mode and LED2 toggles the last state.
  
In this example Period value is set to 1000, so each time the counter counts
(1000 + 1) rising edges on LPTIM1_IN1 pin, an interrupt is generated and LED2
toggles. If the external function generator is set to provide a square waveform at 1Khz,
the led will toggle each second.

In this example the internal clock provided to the LPTIM1 is LSI (32 kHz),
so the external input is sampled with LSI clock. In order not to miss any event,
the frequency of the changes on the external Input1 signal should never exceed the
frequency of the internal clock provided to the LPTIM1 (LSI for the
present example).

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    
  - Connect a square waveform generator to PB.05 (pin 29 in CN10 connector).
    If the frequency of the signal is 1 kHz, LED2 toggles every second.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
