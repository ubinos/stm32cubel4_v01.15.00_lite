@par Application Description 

This directory contains a binary template (in DFU format) to be loaded into Flash memory using Device 
Firmware Upgrade application. This file was converted to the DFU format using the "DFU File Manager Tool"
included in the "DfuSe" PC software install.
For more details on how to convert a .bin file to DFU format please refer to the UM0412 user manual 
"Getting started with DfuSe USB device firmware upgrade STMicroelectronics extension" available from the
STMicroelectronics microcontroller website www.st.com.
   
This binary is a simple LED Toggling (LED1).
The system Timer (Systick) is used for to generate the delay.
The offset address of this binary is 0x0800C000 which matches the definition in DFU application
"USBD_DFU_APP_DEFAULT_ADD".


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L476G-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
